Robo-advisors, as defined by Investopedia, are digital platforms that provide automated, algorithm-driven financial planning services with little to no human supervision. A typical robo-advisor collects information from clients about their financial situation and future goals through an online survey and then uses the data to offer advice and automatically invest client assets. 

Here I will be doing just thigs by using AWS or Amazon Web Sertvices to develop a robo advisor that could be used by clients and potential new clients to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement. Inside of AWS I will be making use of Lex to interact with the client and I will combine this with the abilities of Lambda. Lambda will run the code to create the responses from Lex's interactions. Enjoy!
