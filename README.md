Robo-advisors, as defined by Investopedia, are digital platforms that provide automated, algorithm-driven financial planning services with little to no human supervision. A typical robo-advisor collects information from clients about their financial situation and future goals through an online survey and then uses the data to offer advice and automatically invest client assets. 

Here I will be doing just this by using AWS or Amazon Web Services to develop a robo advisor that could be used by clients and potential new clients to receive investment portfolio recommendations for retirement. Inside of AWS I will be making use of Lex to interact with the client and I will combine this with the abilities of Lambda. Lambda will run the code to create the responses from Lex's interactions. Robo Advisor's are assisting the common man by alloting the expertise of a financial professional while cutting the price of an actual financial advisor. Enjoy!
