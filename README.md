Robo-advisors, as defined by Investopedia, are digital platforms that provide automated, algorithm-driven financial planning services with little to no human supervision. A typical robo-advisor collects information from clients about their financial situation and future goals through an online survey and then uses the data to offer advice and automatically invest client assets. 

Here I will be doing just this by using AWS or Amazon Web Services to develop a robo advisor that could be used by clients and potential new clients to receive investment portfolio recommendations for retirement. Inside of AWS I will be making use of Lex to interact with the client and I will combine this with the abilities of Lambda. Lambda will run the code to create the responses from Lex's interactions. Robo Advisor's are assisting the common man by alloting the expertise of a financial professional while cutting the price of an actual financial advisor. Enjoy!

The files can all be found in the RoboAdvisor folder. The code for the Lambda function can be found in recommend_portfolio.py. The intent for Lex is the RecommendPortfolio_Intent_LEX_V1.zip. The slot for Lex is RiskLevel_SlotType_LEX_V1.zip. The bot information for Lex can be found in RoboAdvisor_1_68Bot_LEX_V1.zip. A video demo of the bot and all of its glory can be found as a .mov file, RoboAdvisor_Demo_Video.mov.
